1. Allow IP with port request from remote computers and devices.
   
   Open command prompt with Run as Administrator:
   - Need to allow IP with port incoming connection, type this and enter:
     netsh http add urlacl url=http://192.168.0.103:51122/ user=everyone
   
   - This just tells http.sys that it’s ok to talk to this url, type this and enter:
     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="IISExpressWeb" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=51122 profile=private remoteip=localsubnet action=allow
